What options do you have other than web development which can uplift you financially in one or two years?

You have nothing. And you don't like your work at all. You don't want to do the same mundane things daily.
Instead, you choose to be in a creative field with endless opportunity. Commit yourself for a year day in & day out.
Creation is the ultimate pleasure you will never find anywhere.
